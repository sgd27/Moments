- Redux-like state management

- Pull down to refresh and pull up to load more

  

## Caveat

Since the recruiter told me that there's no special requirement for deployment target, I started the project with SwiftUI, which I would like to try. So the project only runs on devices with iOS 13+. 

The coding experience with SwiftUI is good, but it's buggy. And it lacks a lot of features. Sometime I had to fallback to UIKit.
